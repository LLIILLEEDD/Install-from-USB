# Install-from-USB
Automatic installation of programs from a USB flash drive
I inserted the flash drive and launched it. Relax and chill

The script was made for my personal needs at work when preparing a new computer. This is not very difficult, you can add new programs, the main thing is to know their key for silent installation. I don't know if this will be useful to anyone, but maybe someone can tell me something useful. I'm new here.
